				New Eyes for Needy &amp; Mott Street Optical Group <br>  
                The importance of giving back to the community <br><br />
                
              At Mott Street Optical Group, we're more than a business that sells glasses. We value the relationships that we build and the trust that we garner throughout our 20+ years in business. We always feel the call of duty from our community and understand fully what our community responsibilities are. Consequently, we have a donation program for used glasses, highlighting the fact that we are dedicated to providing others that are less fortunate than us with the chance to see clearly.<br><br />
			  We have sent over a thousand pairs of customers' used glasses to New Eyes for the Needy, which is a company based in New Jersey who give these frames to those in need nationally and internationally since 1932. We are continuously donating frames so if you have an old pair that you do not wear anymore, feel free to donate them at any of our locations.<br><br />
              Thank you for helping out with us on a worthy cause. Remember as John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." This small gesture of care can make a difference and we hope that you can help us make a difference in the world.<br><br />
